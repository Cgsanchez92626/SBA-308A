# SBA-308A
My repository name is: "# SBA-308A"
This is the link to the GitHub Directory: https://github.com/Cgsanchez92626/SBA-308A.git
This is a refactor of a site built in SBA-307,modified in SBA-316, and now again, modifying it to put into it all the things
I have learned while wanting to satisfy the requirements for the assignment SBA-308A
This delivery is focused on delivering the Services Tab (when Clicked)
It allows the user to input a zipcode 
The entry is used to make a call using rapidapi's API to zillow
Results are brought back and the user can scroll through them and click on a link which will take them to the full listing details on zillow.
At a high level, I have:
- reused Global.js and Global.css to maintain the look/feel and the
navigation bars.
- Introduced Services.html, Services.js, Carousel.js, Services.css
  Mainly to practice using an API to get data, I had issues finding anything in the realestate world that I could post to without having to dish out some mulah :)
  - used import/export to share processing across the web-site
  - Use Async on some of the functions to boost performance
  - Learned a ton, in using the developers tools to get the Carousel to display and move as I prefered it to.
  - Ensured nothing broke on the existing functionality
